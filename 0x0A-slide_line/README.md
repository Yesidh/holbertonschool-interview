# :colombia: 0x0A-slide_line
## Goal
The goal of this task is to reproduce the 2048 game(NSFW !!) mechanics on a single horizontal line.

Given an array of integers, we want to be able to slide & merge it to the left or to the right. Identical numbers, if they are contiguous or separated by zeros, should be merged
## Prerequisites
- Write a function that slides and merges an array of integers
- Prototype: int slide_line(int *line, size_t size, int direction);
- Where line points to an array of integers containing size elements, that must be slided & merged to the direction represented by direction. direction can be either:
  - SLIDE_LEFT
  - SLIDE_RIGHT
  - If it is something else, the function must fail
  - Both macros SLIDE_LEFT and SLIDE_RIGHT must be defined in slide_line.h
- Your function must return 1 upon success, or 0 upon failure
- You are not allowed to allocate memory dynamically (malloc, calloc, â€¦)
## Built With
- Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic## Contributing
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
## Versioning
for my learning in Holberton School
