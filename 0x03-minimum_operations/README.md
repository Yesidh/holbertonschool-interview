# :colombia: 0x03. Minimum Operations                                                              
In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.
## Examples
n = 9

H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste =>HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH

Number of operations: 6

## Prerequisites
- Prototype: def minOperations(n)
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All your files must be executable
## Built With
- Python 3.4.3
- Pep8(1.7)
